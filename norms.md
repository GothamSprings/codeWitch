Disagreements
  Use consensus. Everyone gets a vote. You can abstain if you don’t care. A no drags it out until we agree. 
  In general, talk about it and be open. We can pull in a third party. ask the instructor for a recommendation.

Frustration
  Crying in public and long walks in lower Manhattan. No jumping into Gotham Springs.
  Try to work it out one-on-one first if we’re disagreeing, then pull in others to mediate

When do we ask for help?
  Each pair decides
	
Interruptions
  Don’t break mimi’s flow, slack is fine
  Slack Shiau-uen and she’ll ignore notification until she’s ready
  Don’t slack Roxie at school b/c notifications are off, shoulder tap is fine
  Neha prefers in person

Nights & Weekends // 
  Neha is fine with coming in/staying late
  Shiau-uen can find some extra hours but probably not come in to FS
  Roxie nights/weekends are a yes, fine with traveling or not
  Mimi is available nights and weekends but not coming into FS, prefers to work at home

Time estimates & Planning
  Don’t assign time limits for people. Use general guesstimates.

Schedule
  Beginning of day stand up - What I did, What I’m going to do next, blockers
  End of day meetings - What we did today, setting the agenda for the next day
